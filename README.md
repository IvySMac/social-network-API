# Social Network API

## Description 

There are many different methods to keep data within a database. Before, we were using MySQL but this time we are diving into the world of NoSQL. 
In this activity, I'll be using Mongoose and MongoDB to store and retrieve data to be used as a mock-social media website. This gives a lot more insight on what is happening behind the curtains of your favorite social media site. 

## Usage

To use this app, you will first need to seed the files. Do this by typing in `npm run seed` in your terminal 

Now that your files are seeded, run the app by typing in `npm run dev`

Once its up and running, you will open either Insomnia or ThunderClient to test both Thoughts/Comments and User routes.
